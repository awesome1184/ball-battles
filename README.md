## Prototype features

- Daily deterministic weapon matchup with an animated canvas battle.
- Clean portrait arena with solid red/green/magenta balls, readable per-ball health, and spinning weapon sprites.
- Gravity, wall/floor collisions, and continuous physical rebounds without scheduled jumps.
- Lance damage ramp and Duplicator team replication: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 balls during a fight.
- Daily coin claim, one prediction per daily matchup, and simulated community odds.
- Eleven weapon balls: Sword, Dagger, Spear, Axe, Hammer, Scythe, Chakram, Trident, Bow, Lance, and Duplicator.
- Individual 50-coin contributions for base damage, scaling, weapon size, projectile rate, attack delay, and spin speed. Each contribution gives a tiny permanent gain with harmonic diminishing returns.
- Fight records and a local developer test panel.
- Sound toggle and 1× / 2× battle speed.

## Current prototype boundaries

Coins, upgrades, predictions, and records are stored in the current browser using localStorage. They do not sync between players or devices. The official daily matchup is generated from the date, so players load the same matchup and deterministic fight simulation, but the displayed community percentages are currently demo values rather than a live shared pool. There is no account system or server-side validation yet.
